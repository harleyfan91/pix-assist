# CameraScreen Refactoring Summary

## Extracted: `useCameraControls` Hook

### What was extracted:
- **Flash controls**: `flashMode`, `flashModeRef`, `handleFlashToggle`, `flashAnimation`, `captureFlash`, `setCaptureFlash`
- **Camera mode expansion**: `isCameraModeExpanded`, `cameraModeExpansion`, `toggleCameraModeExpansion`
- **Exposure controls**: `showExposureControls`, `isExposureControlsVisible`, `exposureControlsAnimation`, `exposureSlider`, `sliderValue`, `toggleExposureControls`, `handleExposureSliderChange`
- **Photo capture state**: `isCapturing`, `setIsCapturing`
- **Button states**: `shutterPressed`, `setShutterPressed`
- **Utilities**: `triggerHaptic` function
- **Effects**: Flash mode debugging, camera mode expansion animation, exposure controls visibility animation

### Benefits:
1. **Reduced CameraScreen size**: Removed ~200 lines of state management and control logic
2. **Better separation of concerns**: Camera controls are now isolated and reusable
3. **Improved testability**: Hook can be tested independently
4. **Cleaner main component**: CameraScreen now focuses on UI composition rather than control logic
5. **Reusability**: Hook can be used in other camera-related components

### Files modified:
- **Created**: `app/hooks/useCameraControls.ts` (new hook)
- **Modified**: `app/screens/CameraScreen.tsx` (removed extracted logic, added hook usage)

## Extracted: `useCameraGestures` Hook

### What was extracted:
- **Focus functionality**: `handleFocusTap`, focus ring state (`showFocusRing`, `focusRingOpacity`, `focusRingPosition`)
- **Gesture definitions**: `shutterButtonGesture`, `tapGesture`, `pinchGesture`, `cameraGestures`
- **Zoom management**: `onZoomStart`, `handleZoomUpdate`, `onZoomEnd` functions
- **Camera ref management**: `_cameraRef`, `setCameraRef`
- **Gesture logic**: Tap-to-focus with control area detection, pinch-to-zoom with snap-to-neutral

### Benefits:
1. **Reduced CameraScreen complexity**: Removed ~150 lines of gesture logic
2. **Better separation of concerns**: All gesture handling is now isolated
3. **Improved reusability**: Gesture logic can be reused in other camera components
4. **Enhanced maintainability**: Easier to find and modify gesture behavior
5. **Cleaner main component**: CameraScreen now focuses on UI composition

### Files modified:
- **Created**: `app/hooks/useCameraGestures.ts` (new hook, 200+ lines)
- **Modified**: `app/screens/CameraScreen.tsx` (removed gesture logic, added hook usage)

## Extracted: `useCameraAnimations` Hook

### What was extracted:
- **Shared values**: `previewAnimation` for preview visibility animations
- **Derived values**: `exposureValue` for camera exposure mapping
- **Animated props**: `animatedCameraProps` for camera exposure
- **Animated styles**: 8 different animated styles including:
  - `animatedCameraModeStyle` - Camera mode button expansion
  - `animatedCameraControlsOpacity` - Control icons opacity
  - `animatedFlashStyle` - Flash effect overlay
  - `animatedPreviewStyle` - Preview screen animations
  - `animatedFocusRingStyle` - Focus ring positioning
  - `animatedChevronStyle` - Chevron rotation and positioning
  - `animatedPopupStyle` - Popup visibility and scaling
  - `animatedExposureControlsStyle` - Exposure controls slide animation

### Benefits:
1. **Reduced CameraScreen complexity**: Removed ~100 lines of animation logic
2. **Centralized animation management**: All Reanimated logic in one place
3. **Improved performance**: Better organization of shared values and derived values
4. **Enhanced maintainability**: Easier to find and modify animation behavior
5. **Better separation of concerns**: Animations are now isolated from UI logic

### Files modified:
- **Created**: `app/hooks/useCameraAnimations.ts` (new hook, 150+ lines)
- **Modified**: `app/screens/CameraScreen.tsx` (removed animation logic, added hook usage)

### Next steps for further refactoring:
1. Extract `CameraView` component (the actual camera component)
2. Extract `CameraControls` component (bottom control bar)
3. Extract `CameraOverlay` component (focus ring, popups)
4. Extract styles to separate file

### Lines reduced:
- **Before**: 1560 lines
- **After**: ~1076 lines (484 lines extracted across three hooks)
- **Reduction**: ~31% smaller
