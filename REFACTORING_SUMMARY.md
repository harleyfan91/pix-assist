# CameraScreen Refactoring Summary

## Extracted: `useCameraControls` Hook

### What was extracted:
- **Flash controls**: `flashMode`, `flashModeRef`, `handleFlashToggle`, `flashAnimation`, `captureFlash`, `setCaptureFlash`
- **Camera mode expansion**: `isCameraModeExpanded`, `cameraModeExpansion`, `toggleCameraModeExpansion`
- **Exposure controls**: `showExposureControls`, `isExposureControlsVisible`, `exposureControlsAnimation`, `exposureSlider`, `sliderValue`, `toggleExposureControls`, `handleExposureSliderChange`
- **Photo capture state**: `isCapturing`, `setIsCapturing`
- **Button states**: `shutterPressed`, `setShutterPressed`
- **Utilities**: `triggerHaptic` function
- **Effects**: Flash mode debugging, camera mode expansion animation, exposure controls visibility animation

### Benefits:
1. **Reduced CameraScreen size**: Removed ~200 lines of state management and control logic
2. **Better separation of concerns**: Camera controls are now isolated and reusable
3. **Improved testability**: Hook can be tested independently
4. **Cleaner main component**: CameraScreen now focuses on UI composition rather than control logic
5. **Reusability**: Hook can be used in other camera-related components

### Files modified:
- **Created**: `app/hooks/useCameraControls.ts` (new hook)
- **Modified**: `app/screens/CameraScreen.tsx` (removed extracted logic, added hook usage)

## Extracted: `useCameraGestures` Hook

### What was extracted:
- **Focus functionality**: `handleFocusTap`, focus ring state (`showFocusRing`, `focusRingOpacity`, `focusRingPosition`)
- **Gesture definitions**: `shutterButtonGesture`, `tapGesture`, `pinchGesture`, `cameraGestures`
- **Zoom management**: `onZoomStart`, `handleZoomUpdate`, `onZoomEnd` functions
- **Camera ref management**: `_cameraRef`, `setCameraRef`
- **Gesture logic**: Tap-to-focus with control area detection, pinch-to-zoom with snap-to-neutral

### Benefits:
1. **Reduced CameraScreen complexity**: Removed ~150 lines of gesture logic
2. **Better separation of concerns**: All gesture handling is now isolated
3. **Improved reusability**: Gesture logic can be reused in other camera components
4. **Enhanced maintainability**: Easier to find and modify gesture behavior
5. **Cleaner main component**: CameraScreen now focuses on UI composition

### Files modified:
- **Created**: `app/hooks/useCameraGestures.ts` (new hook, 200+ lines)
- **Modified**: `app/screens/CameraScreen.tsx` (removed gesture logic, added hook usage)

## Extracted: `useCameraAnimations` Hook

### What was extracted:
- **Shared values**: `previewAnimation` for preview visibility animations
- **Derived values**: `exposureValue` for camera exposure mapping
- **Animated props**: `animatedCameraProps` for camera exposure
- **Animated styles**: 8 different animated styles including:
  - `animatedCameraModeStyle` - Camera mode button expansion
  - `animatedCameraControlsOpacity` - Control icons opacity
  - `animatedFlashStyle` - Flash effect overlay
  - `animatedPreviewStyle` - Preview screen animations
  - `animatedFocusRingStyle` - Focus ring positioning
  - `animatedChevronStyle` - Chevron rotation and positioning
  - `animatedPopupStyle` - Popup visibility and scaling
  - `animatedExposureControlsStyle` - Exposure controls slide animation

### Benefits:
1. **Reduced CameraScreen complexity**: Removed ~100 lines of animation logic
2. **Centralized animation management**: All Reanimated logic in one place
3. **Improved performance**: Better organization of shared values and derived values
4. **Enhanced maintainability**: Easier to find and modify animation behavior
5. **Better separation of concerns**: Animations are now isolated from UI logic

### Files modified:
- **Created**: `app/hooks/useCameraAnimations.ts` (new hook, 150+ lines)
- **Modified**: `app/screens/CameraScreen.tsx` (removed animation logic, added hook usage)

## Extracted: Styles to Separate File

### What was extracted:
- **All style constants**: 53 style definitions moved to `CameraScreen.styles.ts`
- **Style types**: `ViewStyle`, `TextStyle`, `ImageStyle` imports
- **Style organization**: Grouped by functionality (containers, buttons, overlays, etc.)

### Benefits:
1. **Massive file size reduction**: CameraScreen reduced from 1,517 to 1,033 lines (32% smaller)
2. **Improved maintainability**: Styles are now organized and easy to find
3. **Better separation of concerns**: Component logic separated from styling
4. **Enhanced reusability**: Styles can be imported by other components
5. **Cleaner code**: Component file now focuses on logic, not styling

### Files modified:
- **Created**: `app/screens/CameraScreen.styles.ts` (53 style definitions)
- **Modified**: `app/screens/CameraScreen.tsx` (removed styles, added import)

### Style Organization Best Practices:
- **Separate Style Files**: Always extract styles to dedicated `.styles.ts` files for components with 5+ style definitions
- **Import Pattern**: Use `import * as styles from "./ComponentName.styles"` for clean style references
- **Naming Convention**: Use `$styleName` pattern for style constants (e.g., `$container`, `$button`)
- **File Structure**: Place style files alongside component files (e.g., `ComponentName.tsx` + `ComponentName.styles.ts`)

### Next steps for further refactoring:
1. Extract `CameraView` component (the actual camera component)
2. Extract `CameraControls` component (bottom control bar)
3. Extract `CameraOverlay` component (focus ring, popups)
4. Apply style extraction to other large components (GalleryScreen, TopNavigation, etc.)

### Lines reduced:
- **Before**: 1,517 lines
- **After**: 1,033 lines (484 lines extracted to styles file)
- **Total reduction**: ~32% smaller
